            As an avid kayaker I've often found myself visiting places surrounded by water but unable to explore the area since I didn't have my kayak with me. Many of those times I've looked into renting a kayak and found I needed to drive 20 or 30+ minutes to pick one up. If I'm renting a car or don't have my kayak J bars on my car, I then had to worry about the logistics of safely mounting the kayak(s) with the cheap twine and foam blocks the renal place gives you (always sketchy). More often than not the thought of spending at least an hour picking up and dropping off a kayak, along with figuring out how I'm going to safely mount it on my vehicle, deters me from renting one and exploring the area when I'm visit places.

            I was out on Winnipesaukee this spring paddling around Welch island when I realized there had to be plenty of people who had the same thought process I did while visiting THIS area. After researching the greater lakes area I found the majority of marinas and sporting goods stores were charging $30-$80 a day to rent a kayak. I also found that most people renting didn't use their kayaks for more than 2 hours. After quite a bit of looking, I couldn't find a single place in the entire lakes region area that offered any type of mobile guided kayak tour service that came to you. There were guided kayak fishing tour services, but none that just offered recreational kayaking that would come to you on whatever body off water you wanted to explore. While I know many enjoy canoeing and the growing trend of paddle boarding, I decided I wanted to just focus on what I loved to do- kayaking. After a little thought, I decided Lakes Region Kayak Adventures was the best name for the business.
            My primary kayak adventure is two hours long with a minimum of two people. I also offer a family friendly one hour trip that has a minimum of four or more people. If a client would like to do a trip longer than two hours, I'm happy to customize individual adventures on a case by case basis.

            My primary demographic is people interested in going out for a yak who do not own a kayak or do not want to worry about transporting them to and from a rental location. Many are visiting the area and may own a kayak but do not have one with them. But there are certainly locals in this demographic as well. Whether you are a tourists or a local, if you don't own a kayak already you are likely overwhelmed at the thought of transporting 2, 3 or more kayaks on your vehicle at one time. And even if you do have the means, you may be worried about damaging your vehicle or hurting yourself in the loading and unloading process. I come to you where ever you want to go- lake, pond, rental house etc. I put the kayaks in the water for you and take them out when you're done, as well as guide you on your adventure. After many years of kayaking numerous bodies of water in the lakes region, I can recommend several great spots to explore. That said, I am happy to go where ever a client would would like to adventure.
